# Tagging Guide

Rules for selecting hashtags when creating notes via MakeNote.

## Core Principle

Tags create **logical groupings** for finding notes later. They are broad topic categories, not descriptions of the note content. Less is more.

## Rules

1. **1-3 tags maximum per note.** Most notes need only 1-2.
2. **Topic-level only.** Tags represent domains, not actions or specifics.
3. **Reuse existing tags.** Prefer tags already in the user's Memos instance over inventing new ones.
4. **No redundant tags.** If the note content already makes the topic obvious, fewer tags are fine.

## Good Tags (Examples)

| Tag | When to use |
|-----|-------------|
| `#AIAgents` | AI agent architecture, behavior, orchestration |
| `#security` | Security practices, vulnerabilities, hardening |
| `#authentication` | Auth flows, tokens, identity, access control |
| `#llms` | LLM capabilities, prompting, model behavior |
| `#architecture` | System design, patterns, technical decisions |
| `#devops` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment |
| `#PAI` | PAI system itself — skills, hooks, algorithm |
| `#memoscript` | Memoscript project specifically |
| `#idea` | Loose thoughts, future exploration |

Also use **project names** as tags when the note is project-specific (e.g., `#memoscript`, `#PAI`, `#website`).

## Bad Tags (Never Use)

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `#note` | Redundant — everything is a note |
| `#important` | Subjective, not a topic grouping |
| `#todo` | Use Memos task lists instead |
| `#2026` | Memos already has timestamps |
| `#quickThought` | Action descriptor, not a topic |
| `#JimmySaid` | Attribution, not a topic |

## Tag Selection Process

1. **What domain does this note belong to?** Pick the broadest applicable tag.
2. **Is this project-specific?** Add the project name tag.
3. **Would a second topic tag help find this later?** Add it only if genuinely different from the first.
4. **Stop.** If you're considering a 4th tag, you're over-tagging.
